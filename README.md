# Red-Whine-Quality-Prediction
In this project, we are using a dataset that contains information like fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulfate, and alcohols, and using that to predict the quality of a wine. We will perform all the steps from Data gathering to Model deployment. During Model evaluation, we perform a Random Forest model. Also, we perform scaling on independent data. We got 78% accuracy.
